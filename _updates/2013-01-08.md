* A possibility to create inner shadow, even for bitmaps.
* A possibility to load settings from shadows which was created in 'Drop Shadow 4' macro.   
  Note: If distance and size will be load incorrectly, please try to add ConvertUnits.reg into the registry of Windows and try to load settings again.
* Few small fixes.
