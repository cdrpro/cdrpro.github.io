**SPECIAL OFFER:** be the first one to try the new docker! There is a special **discount 30% off**, only now.
Please note that the docker is still under beta testing. Main functions should work, but errors are possible.

## Overview

Docker CardGenerator is a continuation of the ideas laid in the previous macro.
Basic principles moved from the macro, but the docker got rid of its main problem:
it doesn’t block the use of a computer, because uses own tools for generation of barcodes.
Please note that you cannot use CorelDRAW during the docker’s operation.
However, you can try to run another copy of CorelDRAW and do work in it.

The docker allows to create barcodes in a limited number without activation.
This is the only restriction. Meanwhile you can use free version as much as necessary.
