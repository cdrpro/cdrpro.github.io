## Overview

* **CdrPreflight docker** is intended for displaying full, and most importantly, correct information about the contents of a CorelDRAW document. The macro will help you to find any object in the document with a simple click. Very easy and super fast! You can save a preset for what you want to see. For example, color information only or all effects only.
* **Converter** (integrated in the docker) is used for automatic document editing (changing color models, rasterizing effects, converting fonts to curves and much more). The macro has about 100 options! Tweaking and facilities for saving presets make this macro an extremely helpful tool.
* **Bonus Pack** provides you with different useful functions.
