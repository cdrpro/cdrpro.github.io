### Replace Text <span class="free">FREE</span>

This function allows you to replace text in selected text objects using regular expressions.   
See [the link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to wikipedia for understand what it is.
_Note: The option to select style for replace field is blocked because it's not working in CorelDRAW VBA for now._

## Tech Specs

CorelDRAW VBA must be installed.

### Compatibility

* CorelDRAW X7 (17.0.0.491 or above)

### Localisation

* EnglishUS

### Installation

* Download and run the Installer
* Start CorelDRAW
* Click OK in the pop-up question (if you don't see it, open Macro Manager)

After these actions the docker can be open from menu _Window > Dockers > CdrToolsEx_.

_**NOTE:** This macro will only run on **one machine** (unless you buy multiple macros). If you buy the macro now, and want to run it on a brand new machine or different machine after receiving your first activation code, you must buy it again (please, look Q&A for more information). So, think carefully about which system you want to run it on, because each macro you receive will be locked to one system only. Your product activation key may take up to 24 hours to arrive, but is often much less._

### Computer ID

Click _Activation_ button in the docker.
